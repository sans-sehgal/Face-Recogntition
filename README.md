# Face-Recogntition

Project to detect faces using the haarcascades classifier. This is basically an attendance tool built using openCV. Once the classifier is trained on the faces of the students, it can detect their faces and create an attendace file called "date-today".csv . This file contains the names of the students along with a time stamp, thus documenting when the student entered class as well. Automatic emails are sent to students who may not be present for class on a particular day, or who were late to class.
